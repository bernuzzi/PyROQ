Configuration files contained in this directory provide examples to build the following bases:

* `config_MLGW-BNS_GW170817.ini`: constructs a targeted basis covering the posterior support of GW170817, valid up to SNR~70, using the `mlgw-bns` approximant;
* `config_MLGW-BNS_LVK.ini`: constructs a basis covering the full validity range of the `mlgw-bns` approximant for typical LIGO-Virgo observations, valid up to SNR~70.
* `config_IMRD_Smith_A_simplified.ini`: constructs a basis covering Case A from `arXiv:1604.08253`, in a simplified setting.
